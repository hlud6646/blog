      <description>&lt;p&gt;This is an unstructured collection of reflections on teaching and learning maths.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Notation.&lt;/strong&gt;&#xA;The flexible way that notation is applied in higher studies was a challenge for me as a high school graduate.  For a long time it really did matter to me that vector quantities were written $\textbf{v}$ or $\overline{v}$ rather than $v$.&#xA;Now I couldn&amp;rsquo;t care less most of the time but I think it helps to&#xA;remember that this was something that for me at least required some getting used to.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
