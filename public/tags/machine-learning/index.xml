      <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m filling in some gaps from my masters and one of the side-quests&#xA;that I never completed was coding up a neural network from scratch.&#xA;These models have the reputation of being a &amp;lsquo;black box&amp;rsquo; where&#xA;data goes in and predictions magically come out. Building one up&#xA;takes away this feeling and reminds you that they&amp;rsquo;re just a clever&#xA;system of linear algebra cogs.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This post develops a single hidden layer perceptron in OOP style.&#xA;It is obviously not supposed to be very good, but three demonstrations&#xA;after the model class show that it definitely works.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
