    <section><h3 id="me">Me</h3>
<p>I started programming in my final year of high-school, when my maths teacher
introduced <a href="projecteuler.net">Project Euler</a> to the class. These problems are
supposed to be solved by a combination of tricky maths and algorithmic programming,
and I still think they&rsquo;re the best way to get a feeling for a new language.</p>
<!-- TODO: link to the Elixir post when completed. -->
<p>Since then I&rsquo;ve done an undergrad degree in maths, done a fair bit of
maths tutoring, and recently finished a masters in data-science.  Along
the way I&rsquo;ve stayed interested in software and have been drawn to the functional
programming paradigm. This blog is part portfolio, part collection, part reference
of all these things.</p>
<h3 id="this-site">This Site</h3>
<p>I&rsquo;ve played with a few static site generators, and <a href="https://gohugo.io">Hugo</a>
has been the nicest experience.  The <a href="https://themes.gohugo.io/themes/hugo-paper/">Paper Theme</a> looks good out of the box and is easy to customise.
Incidentally I have never looked at the Go programming language before this
project, but since nothing fancy is really happening there&rsquo;s been hardly
any need to learn anything. Most of the functionality is contained in the
config.toml file.</p>
<p>One particularly nice aspect of a static site is that you can push it to
surge.sh with a custom url prefix and have it live in seconds for free.</p>
