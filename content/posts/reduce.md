*On the unreasonable usefulness of a single function.*

I recently decided to learn Elixir and started by doing
the first 50 problems on Project Euler.  What I noticed 
as I did this work was theat the `Enum.reduce\3` function
kept coming up. This function is basically the `foldl` or 
`foldr` that you would see in most functional languages 
with the difference that it can act as either of these.
....

Is this actually intersting?
