A young student of mine told me that they had started a new topic
in class, namely symmetries of plane figures. These were translations,
reflections and rotations of polygons and some irregular shapes. This
was a good opportunity to do an exercise involving symmetries that I've
done a few times with young high-school students (maybe once with a primary
school student) which is to fill
in the Cayley table for the dihedral group. It took us an hour, starting
with drawing a perfect equilateral triangle (a good problem in its own
right); defining the expression 'symmetry preserving transformation' and
then
finding them all; learning that such a transformation can be described
by the action on the vertices; discussing the idea that 'doing nothing'
is a transformation; and finally drawing a table with seven rows and
columns (also a non-trivial task apparently).

We then started to compose them, doing for example two rotations and then
a flip, and noticing that this is the same a doing a flip and then a single
rotation.  It's a joy to watch a young person work these out, since with
the right framework they are able to comfortably handle group algebra with a
non-commutative operation. For example my student had no
problem at all with the reasoning $RF + FR = R + FF + R = R + e + R = RR$ (since
it could so easily be verified)
and was pleased when I pointed out that we were doing algebra not with
numbers but with symmetry preserving rotations. The final test is to ask
them to look for patterns in the table as they fill it in, giving them
the opportunity to notice the 'sudoku' pattern, i.e. that every row and
column must contain every element.
