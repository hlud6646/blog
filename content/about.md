### Me

I started programming in my final year of high-school, when my maths teacher
introduced [Project Euler](projecteuler.net) to the class. These problems are
supposed to be solved by a combination of tricky maths and algorithmic programming,
and I still think they're the best way to get a feeling for a new language.

Since then I've done an undergrad degree in maths, done a fair bit of
maths tutoring, and recently finished a masters in data-science.  Along
the way I've stayed interested in software and have been drawn to the functional
programming paradigm. This blog is part portfolio, part collection, part reference
of all these things.


### This Site
I've played with a few static site generators, and [Hugo](https://gohugo.io)
has been the nicest experience.  The [Paper Theme](https://themes.gohugo.io/themes/hugo-paper/) looks good out of the box and is easy to customise.
Incidentally I have never looked at the Go programming language before this
project, but since nothing fancy is really happening there's been hardly
any need to learn anything. Most of the functionality is contained in the
config.toml file.

One particularly nice aspect of a static site is that you can push it to
surge.sh with a custom url prefix and have it live in seconds for free.
